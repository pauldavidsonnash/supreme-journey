Artists are posted to the Opry website as soon as appearances are confirmed (artists and schedule subject to change).

She finished college at Belmont University in Nashville, specializing in commercial music. Upon graduation, she apprenticed in the pop country industry, worked at an esteemed Triple A radio station, and lent her vocal gifts to demo recordings for songwriters and publishers. Her singing prowess in this context caught the attention of a respected label putting together a singing group. Jessie passed on the opportunity and instead worked briefly with one of the other artists, eventually joining him and his band on a month-long tour. That experience would be formative, imbuing Jessie with the confidence and bravery to search for the pure music within, away from the whims of the industry.<\/p>","datePosted":"2016-05-06 11:53:19","link":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/jessie-smith-cafe-fontanella\/","guid":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/jessie-smith-cafe-fontanella\/","source":"www.nowplayingnashville.com","dateindex":0.55189814814815,"dates":["06-08-2016"],"datetimes":[{"date":"06-08-2016","date2":"JUN 08, 2016","time":"7:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-08 19:00","time2":"7 PM Wednesday","endtime":"9:00 pm","timeendtime":"7pm-9pm"}]},{"ID":"134202","spotlight":"false","featured":"false","orgImage":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/images\/org\/64750\/mercy1.jpeg","Image":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/images\/2016\/05\/49_Edp.jpg","Name":"Noise Pollution | The Music of AC\/DC with Sleeping Village","DateBegin":"06-08-2016","DateEnd":"06-08-2016","Days":"Wednesday","ongoing":"N","orgID":"64750","orgName":"Mercy Lounge","Url":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/noise-pollution-music-acdc-sleeping-village\/","venueID":"2705","venueName":"Mercy Lounge","TicketInfo":"<p>$7\/Ticket; 18+<\/p>","TicketUrl":"http:\/\/www.ticketweb.com\/t3\/sale\/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&eventId=6717445","Type":"Music","secondaryType":"MUSIC, ROCK + POP","Description":"<p>Noise pollution performs The music of AC\/DC performed loud and proud.

So grab your friends and come spend the weekends with a bottle of wine and Rhythm &amp; Vine.\n\nFrom the heart of Dairyland USA comes country music\u2019s next big thing. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MikeMuellerMusic\/info\/?tab=page_info\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Mike Mueller<\/strong><\/a> grew up on 80\u2019s Hair Metal and 90\u2019s Pop and Rock music, until he started his job as a farm hand at 12 where he fell in love with country music. \u201cI had never listened to country music before I started working on the farm and one of the first songs I heard on the radio was George Strait's Write This Down. I was hooked immediately.\u201d As Mike got older he fell more and more in love with performing and writing country music, so he set his sights for Nashville, August 2014. Unfortunately, a person does not just come to Nashville and a couple months later become a superstar. There is a lot of hard work that gets put into the craft and a network of loyal people you need to build relationships with to make things work and Mike did just that when he moved. Mike has been critically acclaimed by country superstars Florida Georgia Line for his cover of their multi-platinum hit single, Cruise on his YouTube page (muellertime100), which has led to endless opportunities. He has gotten to know staff members over at Big Loud Shirt Publishing to point him in the right direction and meet and write with some of the biggest people in town.\nWhile Mike is still an act in the making and gaining experience, every opportunity he gets he makes the most of. He provides and upbeat good\/fun vibe to his live shows that connects directly with his audience. Mike is beginning to set up his tour for the summer and fall of 2016 and hopes to travel all across the country to continue to grow his fan base organically. As he continues to grow as an artist and songwriter, he plans to stay true to his country roots to provide quality entertainment and an up-tempo vibe for any occasion.<\/p>","datePosted":"2016-05-13 16:16:27","link":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/mike-mueller-2\/","guid":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/mike-mueller-2\/","source":"www.nowplayingnashville.com","dateindex":3.5518981481481,"dates":["06-11-2016"],"datetimes":[{"date":"06-11-2016","date2":"JUN 11, 2016","time":"2:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-11 14:00","time2":"2 PM Saturday","endtime":"4:00 pm","timeendtime":"2pm-4pm"}]},{"ID":"133003","spotlight":"false","featured":"false","orgImage":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/images\/org\/64808\/opry.jpg","Image":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/images\/event\/86898\/opryryman.jpg","Name":"Opry at the Ryman Matinee feat.

But when she was barely out of high school, Mary Bragg spent 6 months in Nashville as a sprite, eager singer, like so many &ndash; looking to be discovered. During one especially memorable meeting on Music Row, after hearing her homespun demo, an executive responded, &ldquo;Honey, you ain&rsquo;t got nothing to say. Go out there and live a little &ndash; come back to me in 10 years.&rdquo;<br \/><br \/>And so, she lived. New York was her muse, her trouble, her chaperone. Three albums later, Nashville&rsquo;s magnetism has brought her back to the South &ndash; with many a story to tell.<br \/>After several years of growing acclaim on the Brooklyn Americana scene, she attracted overflow crowds for a year-long residency at NYC&rsquo;s famed venue The Living Room. Her latest recording, Tattoos and Bruises, is a reflection of that series of shows. Produced by one of the genre&rsquo;s contemporary icons, Lee Alexander (Norah Jones, Amos Lee), the album was recorded and mixed at The Coop, the studio belonging to him and his long-time collaborator, Norah Jones.<\/p>","datePosted":"2016-05-25 09:30:08","link":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/mary-bragg-adam-james\/","guid":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/mary-bragg-adam-james\/","source":"www.nowplayingnashville.com","dateindex":3.5518981481481,"dates":["06-11-2016"],"datetimes":[{"date":"06-11-2016","date2":"JUN 11, 2016","time":"9:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-11 21:00","time2":"9 PM Saturday","endtime":"11:30 pm","timeendtime":"9pm-11:30pm"}]},{"ID":"135031","spotlight":"false","featured":"false","orgImage":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/images\/2016\/03\/rocketown.jpg","Image":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/images\/2016\/05\/The-Appeal-To-Heaven-Tour-2.jpg","Name":"An Appeal To Heaven Tour w\/ The Death in Me, Pathway Home and more","DateBegin":"06-11-2016","DateEnd":"06-11-2016","Days":"Saturday","ongoing":"N","orgID":"64810","orgName":"Rocketown","Url":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/appeal-heaven-tour-w-death-pathway-home\/","venueID":"5820","venueName":"Rocketown | Main Venue &amp; Flex Room","TicketInfo":"<p>$8\/Ticket<\/p>","TicketUrl":"http:\/\/www.ticketweb.com\/t3\/sale\/SaleEventDetail?eventId=6712935&pl=rocketown&dispatch=loadSelectionData","Type":"Music","secondaryType":"MUSIC, ROCK + POP","Description":"<p>The <strong>An Appeal to Heaven<\/strong> tour is making a stop in Nashville! <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TheDeathInMe\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Death in Me<\/strong><\/a> with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/PathwayHomeBand\/?fref=photo\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Pathway Home<\/strong><\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/conquerthedistance\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Conquer the Distance<\/strong><\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/fighttoremain\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Fight to Remain<\/strong><\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/chariotthemoon\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Chariot the Moon<\/strong><\/a> will perform.\n\n&nbsp;<\/p>","datePosted":"2016-05-25 12:35:18","link":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/appeal-heaven-tour-w-death-pathway-home\/","guid":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/appeal-heaven-tour-w-death-pathway-home\/","source":"www.nowplayingnashville.com","dateindex":3.5518981481481,"dates":["06-11-2016"],"datetimes":[{"date":"06-11-2016","date2":"JUN 11, 2016","time":"6:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-11 18:00","time2":"6 PM Saturday","endtime":"11:59 pm","timeendtime":"6pm-11:59pm"}]},{"ID":"135224","spotlight":"false","featured":"false","orgImage":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/images\/org\/64717\/douglas_corner.jpg","Image":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/images\/2016\/05\/primary-Brian-Collins-1464292191.jpeg","Name":"Brian Collins","DateBegin":"06-11-2016","DateEnd":"06-11-2016","Days":"Saturday","ongoing":"N","orgID":"64717","orgName":"Douglas Corner Cafe","Url":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/brian-collins-2\/","venueID":"2654","venueName":"Douglas Corner Cafe","TicketInfo":"<p>Free<\/p>","Phone1":"(615) 298-1688","Email":"douglascorner@comcast.net","TicketUrl":"http:\/\/www.douglascorner.com","Type":"Music","secondaryType":"MUSIC, COUNTRY, FREE","Summary":"Brian Collins will be playing Douglas on June 11th at 6PM.

This was made all the sweeter when it garnered Leigh his first, of now seven, Song Of The Year nominations, this one from the Country Music Association (CMA).\u00a0 Two years later, in 1978, Leigh was back at the CMA\u2019s, this time to take home the Song Of The Year award for \"Don\u2019t It Make My Brown Eyes Blue\" which itself has had a phenomenal career: this Leigh composition reached the #1 position on both Pop and County charts and remained on the charts for more than six months. It was nominated at the 20th Grammy Awards in both the Pop and Country Best Song categories (a feat not repeated again until 1993).\u00a0 It won a Grammy Award for Best Country Song and became a million selling single, and was named one of the ten most performed Country Songs Of The Century at the 1999 ASCAP Awards. In addition to his own three Grammy Nominations, five of Leigh\u2019s songs have become vehicles to the Grammy Awards for other artists in the Best Performance, Record of the year, and Vocal Event categories.\n\nTo date, Leigh has made fourteen trips to the Top Ten and has written or co-written nine #1 singles: the hauntingly beautiful \"Somewhere In My Broken Heart\" (written with Billy Dean), voted 1991 Song Of The Year by the Nashville Songwriter\u2019s Association (NSAI), and also by the Academy Of Country Music (ACM); \"Only Here For A Little While\", (written with Wayland Holyfield);\u00a0 \"The Greatest Man I Never Knew\" (written with Layng Martine, Jr.), nominated at the 1993 Grammy Awards for Best Country Song); \"Come From The Heart\" (written with Susanna Clark and recorded by Kathy Mattea); Don Williams\u2019 \"Thats The Thing About Love\" (written with Gary Nicholson); Steve Wariner\u2019s \"Life\u2019s Highway\" (written with Roger Murrah); Mickey Giley\u2019s \"Put Your Dreams Away\" (written with Wayland Holyfield), and the aforementioned \u201cI\u2019ll Get Over You\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t It Make My Brown Eyes Blue\u201d, both written solely by Leigh and recorded by Crystal Gayle.\n\n<strong>Pat Alger<\/strong>:\u00a0 With well over 20 hits to his credit, including eight #1 hits and having played venues all over the world, including a year long tour as opening act for the Everly Brothers Pat Alger is well known in the music industry. Two of the most famous songs written by Pat Alger are \u201cUnanswered Prayer\u201d and \u201cThunder Rolls\u201d co-written with Garth Brooks before Garth was the \u2018Garth Brooks\u2019. \u201cWhat\u2019s She\u2019s Doing Now\u201d and \u201cThat Summer\u201d were two other #1 Hits Pat and Garth wrote.\u00a0\u00a0 Other great classics Pat Alger is responsible for are \u201cOnce In A Very Blue Moon\u201d, \u201cLone Star State of Mind, and \u201cGoin Gone\u201d for Nanci Griffith.\n\n<strong>Adam Falcon:\u00a0 <\/strong>As a teenager, he played in countless bars and clubs throughout the city with numerous bands. At 17, he\u2019d written his first song for the legendary jazz guitarist George Benson, but being too shy to present the song, it wasn\u2019t until 10 years later that the late, iconic music producer, Arif Mardin, heard the song and decided to have Benson record it for Warner Brothers Records.

Especially on a debut album. Time and attention-strapped listeners size up an artist within a song or two, then move on or delve in further. Fortunately, it only takes <strong>Margo Price<\/strong> about twenty-eight seconds to convince you that you're hearing the arrival of a singular new talent. \u201cHands of Time,\u201d the opener on Midwest Farmer's Daughter (coming Spring 2016, Third Man Records), is an invitation, a mission statement and a starkly poetic summary of the 32-year old singer's life, all in one knockout, self-penned punch. Easing in over a groove of sidestick, bass and atmospheric guitar, Price sings, \u201cWhen I rolled out of town on the unpaved road, I was fifty-seven dollars from bein' broke . . .\u201d It has the feel of the first line of a great novel or opening scene in a classic film. There's an expectancy, a brewing excitement. And as the song builds, strings rising around her, Price recalls hardships and heartaches \u2013 the loss of her family's farm, the death of her child, problems with men and the bottle. There is no self-pity or over-emoting. Her voice has that alluring mix of vulnerability and resilience that was once the province of Loretta and Dolly. It is a tour-de-force performance that is vivid, deeply moving and all true. From the honky tonk comeuppance of \u201cAbout To Find Out,\u201d to the rockabilly-charged \u201cThis Town Gets Around\u201d to the weekend twang of \u201cHurtin' (On The Bottle)\u201d, Price adds fresh twists to classic Nashville country, with a sound that could\u2019ve made hits in any decade. Meanwhile, the hard-hitting blues grooves of \u201cFour Years of Chances\u201d and \u201cTennessee Song\u201d push the boundaries further west to Memphis (the album was recorded at the legendary Sun Studio).<\/p>","datePosted":"2016-04-20 12:59:17","link":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/tomorrow-today-margo-price\/","guid":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/tomorrow-today-margo-price\/","source":"www.nowplayingnashville.com","dateindex":6.5518981481481,"dates":["06-14-2016"],"datetimes":[{"date":"06-14-2016","date2":"JUN 14, 2016","time":"8:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-14 20:00","time2":"8 PM Tuesday","endtime":"11:59 pm","timeendtime":"8pm-11:59pm"}]},{"ID":"132128","spotlight":"false","featured":"false","orgImage":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/images\/org\/64729\/ei-logo-nobkgrnd-1.gif","Image":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/images\/2016\/05\/37-elg.png","Name":"Taking Back Tuesday","DateBegin":"06-14-2016","DateEnd":"06-14-2016","Days":"Tuesday","ongoing":"N","orgID":"64729","orgName":"Exit\/In","Url":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/taking-back-tuesday\/","venueID":"2664","venueName":"Exit\/In","TicketInfo":"<p>$7\/Ticket; 21+<\/p>","TicketUrl":"https:\/\/www.ticketfly.com\/purchase\/event\/1156407?_ga=1.52026478.633599167.1438196651","StartTime":"Doors open 9:00pm","Type":"Music","secondaryType":"MUSIC, ROCK + POP","Description":"<p>The year was 2005, for a brief moment in music \u2026 Emo reigned supreme.

Pulling from his life experiences and using them to captivate audiences through passionate, high-energy performances, DePaul&#39;s music is rootsy and organic in nature, allowing him to deeply connect with his audience.<br \/>DePaul was fifteen years old when he began writing songs; songs he was proud of, anyway. He had just walked in the door from school when he decided to sit down and practice some guitar chords his cousin had taught him a few weeks prior. However, after sitting there for about an hour, DePaul had written a song. &quot;I was just messing around with a chord progression and a melody came to me. Then I wrote about a girl, of course. At 15, what else was there?&quot; DePaul then formed a band, which during their 5 active years opened for The Goo Goo Dolls, Eve 6, and other national touring acts.<br \/>Although his music is no stranger to the subjects of love and heartbreak, which surfaces in the track &quot;Adeliene, the Farmer&#39;s Daughter,&quot; he pulls from other life experiences as well. The track &quot;Tooth &amp; Nail&quot; shows the raw emotion in DePaul&#39;s writing. &quot;I wrote Tooth &amp; Nail when I was going through a pretty rough time. I had just gotten back to Nashville from a week stay back home in Ohio when I suddenly became frustrated, fed up even. At that point, all I wanted was something, anything, to define me. &#39;Tooth &amp; Nail&#39; was my way of expressing that I just wanted to know who I was, for me.&quot;<br \/>His first ever, solo EP, &quot;Troubles I Had,&quot; is just that. Each track gives the listener a deeper look into DePaul&#39;s soul, his heartache, and even his ignorance. However, his lyricism tells a truth so many tend to ignore.<\/p>","datePosted":"2016-05-24 10:14:26","link":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/jordan-depaul-paul-luc-leah-blevins\/","guid":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/jordan-depaul-paul-luc-leah-blevins\/","source":"www.nowplayingnashville.com","dateindex":6.5518981481481,"dates":["06-14-2016"],"datetimes":[{"date":"06-14-2016","date2":"JUN 14, 2016","time":"6:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-14 18:00","time2":"6 PM Tuesday","endtime":"11:59 pm","timeendtime":"6pm-11:59pm"}]},{"ID":"136053","spotlight":"false","featured":"false","orgImage":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/images\/2016\/02\/organization-featured-bluebirdcafe-1455660340.jpeg","Image":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/images\/2016\/06\/primary-In-The-Round-with-Kevin-Griffin--Jim-Lauderdale-and-Friends--a-Benefit-For-The-Nashville-Chapter-of-1464891526.jpeg","Name":"Kevin Griffin, Jim Lauderdale and Friends | Benefit Concert","DateBegin":"06-14-2016","DateEnd":"06-14-2016","Days":"Tuesday","ongoing":"N","orgID":"64636","orgName":"The Bluebird Cafe","Url":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/kevin-griffin-jim-lauderdale-friends-benefit-concert\/","venueID":"2607","venueName":"The Bluebird Cafe","TicketInfo":"<p>$20\/Ticket<\/p>","Phone1":"615-383-1461","Email":"info@bluebirdcafe.com","TicketUrl":"http:\/\/bluebirdcafe.com\/event.cfm?id=238139&cart","Type":"Music","secondaryType":"MUSIC, ACOUSTIC + SONGWRITER, COMMUNITY, FUNDRAISERS","Summary":"At The Bluebird, performers include up-and-coming songwriters along with those whose music is regularly on the charts, country music as well as pop, rock and Contemporary Christian hits.","Description":"<p>In The Round with Kevin Griffin, Jim Lauderdale and Friends; a Benefit For The Nashville Chapter of the Recording Academy.<\/p>","datePosted":"2016-06-03 14:56:12","link":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/kevin-griffin-jim-lauderdale-friends-benefit-concert\/","guid":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/kevin-griffin-jim-lauderdale-friends-benefit-concert\/","source":"www.nowplayingnashville.com","dateindex":6.5518981481481,"dates":["06-14-2016"],"datetimes":[{"date":"06-14-2016","date2":"JUN 14, 2016","time":"9:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-14 21:00","time2":"9 PM Tuesday","endtime":"11:59 pm","timeendtime":"9pm-11:59pm"}]},{"ID":"84378","spotlight":"false","featured":"false","orgImage":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/images\/org\/64632\/30329img1.jpg","Image":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/images\/event\/84378\/200x200-janelynch.jpg","Name":"Jane Lynch | See Jane Sing","DateBegin":"06-15-2016","DateEnd":"06-15-2016","Days":"Wednesday","ongoing":"N","orgID":"64632","orgName":"Tennessee Performing Arts Center, TPAC","Url":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/jane-lynch-see-jane-sing\/","venueID":"2632","venueName":"TPAC - James K.

Time and attention-strapped listeners size up an artist within a song or two, then move on or delve in further. Fortunately, it only takes Margo Price about twenty-eight seconds to convince you that you're hearing the arrival of a singular new talent. \u201cHands of Time,\u201d the opener on <em>Midwest Farmer's Daughter<\/em> is an invitation, a mission statement and a starkly poetic summary of the 32-year old singer's life, all in one knockout, self-penned punch. Price adds fresh twists to classic Nashville country, with a sound that could\u2019ve made hits in any decade. Meanwhile, the hard-hitting blues grooves of \u201cFour Years of Chances\u201d and \u201cTennessee Song\u201d push the boundaries further west to Memphis (the album was recorded at the legendary Sun Studio).\n\nAs Price looks ahead to a busy 2016, full of touring and promoting <em>Midwest Farmer's Daughter,<\/em> she reflects on her hopes for what listeners might get from these songs. \u201cI hope that the record helps people get through hard times or depression. That's ultimately what music did for me in my childhood, and especially in my early adult years. It's about being able to connect personally with a song, and hopefully, it makes you feel not so lonely.\u201d<\/p>","datePosted":"2016-06-03 11:22:49","link":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/tomorrow-today-margo-price-kristina-murray\/","guid":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/tomorrow-today-margo-price-kristina-murray\/","source":"www.nowplayingnashville.com","secondaryType":"MUSIC, MUSIC","dateindex":7.5518981481481,"dates":["06-15-2016"],"datetimes":[{"date":"06-15-2016","date2":"JUN 15, 2016","time":"8:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-15 20:00","time2":"8 PM Wednesday","endtime":"11:59 pm","timeendtime":"8pm-11:59pm"}]},{"ID":"88219","spotlight":"false","featured":"false","orgImage":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/images\/org\/65757\/lebanonchamber.jpg","Name":"Jammin' with the General","DateBegin":"06-16-2016","DateEnd":"06-16-2016","Days":"Thursday","ongoing":"N","orgID":"65757","orgName":"Lebanon \/ Wilson County Chamber of Commerce","Url":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/jammin-with-the-general-2\/","venueID":"4713","venueName":"Historic Lebanon Square","TicketInfo":"<p>FREE\nCall for VIP Ticket Pricing<\/p>","Phone1":"615-444-5503","Type":"Music","Description":"<p>Jammin' with the General is a family-friendly live music series hosted by the Lebanon Wilson County Chamber of Commerce Special Events Committee on the Historic Lebanon Public Square.

Raised in Northern Mississippi Kristen draws from her Southern background to tell compelling stories and create a blend of country, roots, and pop sounds. Her voice has a clear, pure tone reminiscent of Dolly Parton that captures audiences and delivers a powerful message.\n\nShe was spoon-fed country classics like Emmylou Harris and Loretta Lynn and used this foundation of country music to develop her sound and grow as a singer-songwriter. As a child she looked forward to piano, guitar and voice lessons and at twelve years old began writing her first songs. Combining influences such as the Dixie Chicks, Michelle Branch, Joni Mitchell, and Shania Twain, Kristen has created a country pop sound that is framed with clever lyrics, memorable melodies and rhythmic instrumentation delivered with an honest, passionate performance.\n\nAfter moving to Nashville Kristen has made significant strides by releasing her first EP titled \"Do You Know Kristen Brassel?\" and music video \"Sway\" which received over a 1,000 views within the first week.\u00a0Her most recent project \u201cLove and Lightning\u201d was released August 26th, 2015. The EP contains 5 handpicked songs that highlight Kristen\u2019s vocal interpretation, songwriting, and personality. The single, also titled \u201cLove and Lightning,\u201d debuted on <em>NoiseTrade<\/em> on June 16th, 2015.\n\nIn addition to becoming a well rounded vocalist and songwriter, she continues to perform with a full band and bring her high energy and enthusiasm to the stage. She has played at notable Nashville venues such as The Bluebird Cafe, The Tin Roof, Silver Dollar Saloon and community and charity events.<\/p>","datePosted":"2016-05-13 12:48:25","link":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/kristen-brassel-4\/","guid":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/kristen-brassel-4\/","source":"www.nowplayingnashville.com","dateindex":9.5518981481481,"dates":["06-17-2016"],"datetimes":[{"date":"06-17-2016","date2":"JUN 17, 2016","time":"8:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-17 20:00","time2":"8 PM Friday","endtime":"10:00 pm","timeendtime":"8pm-10pm"}]},{"ID":"133494","spotlight":"false","featured":"false","orgImage":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/images\/2016\/05\/pujols.jpg","Name":"21 Arts Collaborative","DateBegin":"06-17-2016","DateEnd":"06-17-2016","Days":"Friday","ongoing":"N","orgID":"66691","orgName":"Pujols Family Foundation","Url":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/21-arts-collaborative\/","venueID":"3145","venueName":"The Standard at the Smith House","TicketInfo":"<p>Free AdmissionReservations Requested (You can RSVP through Ticket Link)<\/p>","Phone1":"615-440-6606","Email":"pujols.nashville@gmail.com","TicketUrl":"http:\/\/www.pujolsfamilyfoundation.org\/event\/21-collaborative-arts-project-nashville\/","Type":"Arts","secondaryType":"MUSIC, COMMUNITY, FUNDRAISERS, MUSIC","Summary":"Fine artists from all over the greater Nashville area have volunteered their time and expertise to partner with participants in creating a beautiful work of art.","Description":"<p>Over the course of 2.5 months, painters, sculptors, cartoonists, jewelry designers, and songwriters will work with the other half of their pair, create a piece of art, and auction it off at the culminating event.

Their songs are loud and fast, equal parts unchecked energy and calculated arrangements, with hair-pin turns, raging guitar riffs, and an overload of gang vocals.<\/p>","datePosted":"2016-02-17 13:49:16","link":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/pup-with-rozwell-kid-and-pkew-pkew-pkew\/","guid":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/pup-with-rozwell-kid-and-pkew-pkew-pkew\/","source":"www.nowplayingnashville.com","dateindex":10.551898148148,"dates":["06-18-2016"],"datetimes":[{"date":"06-18-2016","date2":"JUN 18, 2016","time":"9:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-18 21:00","time2":"9 PM Saturday","endtime":"11:59 pm","timeendtime":"9pm-11:59pm"}]},{"ID":"121338","spotlight":"false","featured":"false","orgImage":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/images\/org\/64750\/mercy1.jpeg","Image":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/images\/2016\/03\/primary-Damien-Jurado-1457539266.jpeg","Name":"Black Mountain","DateBegin":"06-18-2016","DateEnd":"06-18-2016","Days":"Saturday","ongoing":"N","orgID":"64750","orgName":"Mercy Lounge","Url":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/damien-jurado-2\/","venueID":"2705","venueName":"Mercy Lounge","TicketInfo":"<p>Tickets On Sale Friday, March 11 at 10:00am<\/p>","TicketUrl":"http:\/\/www.ticketweb.com\/t3\/sale\/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&eventId=6546915","discountUrl":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/enter-to-win\/","Type":"Music","secondaryType":"MUSIC, ROCK + POP","Description":"<p>\"We were toying with the idea of calling the album Our Strongest Material To Date\" laughs Jeremy Schmidt.

This quintessentially Black Mountain tour de force kicks off the renamed but still accurately titled IV. \"It's actually an older song which we couldn't get quite right before,\" explains Schmidt. \"It has all the elements that we gravitate towards, built into one miniature epic.\"\n\nChief among these elements is the distinctive voice and breathtaking range of Amber Webber, whether shes powering through interstellar boogie on Florian Saucer Attack, setting the celestial tone for her beautifully orchestrated ballad Line Them All Up, or constructing the choral midsection for Space To Bakersfield, a psychedelic soul finale inspired by Funkadelic's deathless Maggot Brain.

During a fruitful period of disappearance, the trio have built their own studio, started a record label, and toiled to perfect a formula for effortless sounding pop music that (spoiler alert!) has taken them a huge amount of effort. Something else happened, too. The rise of Swedes in music scenes around the globe gained huge traction. From Avicii and Swedish House Mafia to Lykke Li and Robyn, the flag for Scandinavian genius flew. But one (or \u2013 more accurately \u2013 three) names were missing: those of Peter Moren, Bjorn Yttling and John Eriksson.\n\nThe gang of childhood friends who once bonded over a love of \u201860s baroque pop and Stone Roses famously broke the mould an entire decade ago with one of the catchiest songs to feature whistling ever \u2013 \u201cYoung Folks.\u201d But as bassist and production whizz Bjorn says, \u201cYoung Folks\u201d was not a curse upon a career that is on the verge of entering its seventh era with forthcoming album Breaking Point. \u201cSeven albums seems like an awful lot,\u201d reflects Bjorn. \u201cBut we put them out during a long period so it's OK!\u201d\n\nBreaking Point is about the band's newfound search for another career high. \u201cWe started with some other album title ideas \u2013 like Thriller 2. Then we realised we were pushing the envelope so got into the idea of a breaking point. If we broke it once, we can break it twice,\u201d says Bjorn. That\u2019s why the album artwork features a hammer with three heads on it, not just to strike your nightmares, but to send a message out to everyone. \u201cIt says \u2013 \u2018We\u2019re back! We\u2019re smashing it!\u2019 Haha.\u201d In the literal sense, they may be wielding hammers, but how about musically? \u201cMusically, a breaking point is just about working so hard until you know you can\u2019t do any more,\u201d says Bjorn. \u201cIt\u2019s about being in that fog when you\u2019re creating where you can\u2019t see. That\u2019s when you find something \u2013 the door home, or the door out. You get a chance to turn it around. You have to really put yourself in a big mess to be able to go somewhere new.\u201d\n\nBreaking Point will be released June 10, 2016.<\/p>","datePosted":"2016-05-10 19:39:50","link":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/peter-bjorn-john\/","guid":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/peter-bjorn-john\/","source":"www.nowplayingnashville.com","dateindex":10.551898148148,"dates":["06-18-2016"],"datetimes":[{"date":"06-18-2016","date2":"JUN 18, 2016","time":"9:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-18 21:00","time2":"9 PM Saturday","endtime":"11:59 pm","timeendtime":"9pm-11:59pm"}]},{"ID":"133096","spotlight":"false","featured":"false","orgImage":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/images\/org\/64840\/nashvillerymanauditorium.jpg","Image":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/images\/2016\/05\/primary-Ringo-Starr-and-His-All-Starr-Band-1462974967.jpeg","Name":"Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band","DateBegin":"06-18-2016","DateEnd":"06-18-2016","Days":"Saturday","ongoing":"N","orgID":"64840","orgName":"Ryman Auditorium","Url":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/ringo-starr-starr-band\/","venueID":"2685","venueName":"Ryman Auditorium","TicketInfo":"<p>$50-$250\/TicketTickets On Sale Friday, May 13 at 12:00pmThe password for this presale offer is RINGO.

In this setting, she will be issuing a steady flow of her unvarnished swampy soul.\n\nJessie\u2019s muddy river musicality courses through Al Green, Gladys Knight, Billie Holiday, Mavis Staple singers, Sam Cook, Otis Redding, the haunting tradition of field hollers, and the messy side of life for a dark, redemptive quality. \u201cWhat I want in my own music is the sound of crying.

The show broadcasts live from 3rd &amp; Lindsley on Sundays from 8-10pm.","Description":"<p>When my brother and I started making music as <strong>The Cactus Blossoms<\/strong> there wasn\u2019t a big plan. We cut our teeth performing some well known and obscure country songs that were popular or unpopular pre-1960, partly out of curiosity and deep appreciation, but mostly because it was fun. Early on we were given a residency at the Turf Club in St. Paul, Minnesota. We got a band together and it became our weekly practice-in-public where we would pull out every song we could think of, no matter how well we knew it. It was our first chance to play all night and do whatever we wanted. Over the course of our year and a half at the Turf Club our repertoire had snowballed into an amalgam of original songs and a bunch of gut wrenching, tongue-in-cheek heartbreakers, that were 30 years older than us. Not everyone could tell what was new and what was old, and it didn\u2019t really matter. People just seemed to enjoy it. That\u2019s when the wheel got going and gave the illusion of spinning backwards. We weren\u2019t born in the wrong era. We just got into some music from a different era and found a way to make it our own.\n\nGood fortune has followed us every step of the way, offering opportunities that seemed just beyond what we\u2019re ready for. It always stretches us out and makes us feel lucky as hell. When JD McPherson called and said he was interested in producing our record, it was the latest in a series of serendipitous events that brought us to where we are today. We opened for him at a gig in our hometown Minneapolis a few months earlier and had met him briefly, but never could have imagined that within a year we would be collaborating on a new album and criss-crossing America on tour with his band. JD is a music connoisseur with the singing voice of an angel, the boundless creative energy of a child, a scholar\u2019s mind and the auditory perception of a wolf. This guy was the guy. He wanted to do something sparse and rhythmic with simple melodic arrangements and it lined up perfectly with the direction our new songs were leading us.\n\nWe wanted to record live with the best rhythm section we could find, in one room, playing together while we sang. It\u2019s not the easiest process, but it\u2019s the way we wanted to capture the music. JD pointed us to Chicago and enlisted the talents of engineer\/drummer Alex Hall, guitarist Joel Paterson, and bassist Beau Sample. It felt like a musical dream team, but we had no idea what would happen. We barely knew these guys and they barely knew our music. On the morning of our first session Alex was setting up microphones and running cables through his vents from the living room down to the control room in the basement. The rest of us were drinking coffee in the kitchen and making small talk. JD was running back and forth cracking jokes, trying to decide what song was best to do first. Within a couple of hours \u201cQueen Of Them All\u201d was finished, and everyone knew we were in the right place at the right time.\n\nThe result,\u00a0You\u2019re Dreaming, is the culmination of several years of songwriting and the kindness of thousands of miles and friends. With a cast of characters, experiences, and personal perspectives, set in simple rhymes and sung in harmony, we try to paint a picture in your mind.<\/p>","datePosted":"2016-06-03 11:34:30","link":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/nashville-sunday-night-cactus-blossoms\/","guid":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/nashville-sunday-night-cactus-blossoms\/","source":"www.nowplayingnashville.com","dateindex":11.551898148148,"dates":["06-19-2016"],"datetimes":[{"date":"06-19-2016","date2":"JUN 19, 2016","time":"8:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-19 20:00","time2":"8 PM Sunday","endtime":"11:59 pm","timeendtime":"8pm-11:59pm"}]},{"ID":"117030","spotlight":"false","featured":"false","orgImage":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/images\/org\/64700\/symph.jpg","Image":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/images\/2016\/02\/huey-lewis-news.jpg","Name":"Huey Lewis &amp; the News","DateBegin":"06-20-2016","DateEnd":"06-20-2016","Days":"Monday","ongoing":"N","orgID":"64700","orgName":"Nashville Symphony","Url":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/huey-lewis-the-news\/","venueID":"2635","venueName":"Schermerhorn Symphony Center","TicketInfo":"<p>Various Subscription Packages Available.<\/p>","TicketUrl":"https:\/\/www.nashvillesymphony.org\/tickets\/concert\/2016-huey-lewis-and-the-news","Type":"Music","secondaryType":"MUSIC, ROCK + POP","Summary":"Huey Lewis &amp; The News returns to Nashville!

Mike Mueller grew up on 80\u2019s Hair Metal and 90\u2019s Pop and Rock music, until he started his job as a farm hand at 12 where he fell in love with country music. \u201cI had never listened to country music before I started working on the farm and one of the first songs I heard on the radio was George Strait's <em>Write This Down<\/em>. I was hooked immediately.\u201d As Mike got older he fell more and more in love with performing and writing country music, so he set his sights for Nashville, August 2014. Unfortunately, a person does not just come to Nashville and a couple months later become a superstar. There is a lot of hard work that gets put into the craft and a network of loyal people you need to build relationships with to make things work and Mike did just that when he moved. Mike has been critically acclaimed by country superstars Florida Georgia Line for his cover of their multiplatinum hit single,<em> Cruise<\/em> on his YouTube page (muellertime100), which has led to endless opportunities. He has gotten to know staff members over at Big Loud Shirt Publishing to point him in the right direction and meet and write with some of the biggest people in town.\nWhile Mike is still an act in the making and gaining experience, every opportunity he gets he makes the most of. He provides and upbeat good\/fun vibe to his live shows that connects directly with his audience. Mike is beginning to set up his tour for the summer and fall of 2016 and hopes to travel all across the country to continue to grow his fan base organically. As he continues to grow as an artist and songwriter, he plans to stay true to his country roots to provide quality entertainment and an up-tempo vibe for any occasion.<\/p>","datePosted":"2016-05-13 15:24:32","link":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/mike-mueller\/","guid":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/mike-mueller\/","source":"www.nowplayingnashville.com","dateindex":12.551898148148,"dates":["06-20-2016"],"datetimes":[{"date":"06-20-2016","date2":"JUN 20, 2016","time":"7:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-20 19:00","time2":"7 PM Monday","endtime":"9:00 pm","timeendtime":"7pm-9pm"}]},{"ID":"135000","spotlight":"false","featured":"false","orgImage":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/images\/org\/65754\/familly.jpg","Image":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/images\/2016\/05\/primary-Jesse-Isley-with-Mac-Leaphart-and-Larissia-Murphy-1464190490.jpeg","Name":"Jesse Isley with Mac Leaphart and Larissia Murphy","DateBegin":"06-20-2016","DateEnd":"06-20-2016","Days":"Monday","ongoing":"N","orgID":"65754","orgName":"The Family Wash\/Garage Coffee","Url":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/jesse-isley-mac-leaphart-larissia-murphy\/","venueID":"92500","venueName":"The Family Wash\/Garage Coffee","TicketInfo":"<p>Free<\/p>","TicketUrl":"http:\/\/www.familywash.com\/shows\/2016\/6\/20\/jesse-isley-with-special-guests","Type":"Music","secondaryType":"MUSIC, ROCK + POP","Description":"<p><\/p><p>Nashville guitar slinger Jesse Isley has played guitar since he was 11 years old and performed his first original concert at&nbsp;16.

To capture the attention of Nashvillians and country music visitors, on June 1, 1994, the history of the World Famous Wildhorse Saloon began with country superstar Reba McEntire herding a stampede of live cattle through the streets of Music City, also known as Nashville, Tennessee. The cattle were herded down Second Avenue and past the front doors of the newly opened club. Since then, the Wildhorse has continued to capture the interest of visitors with its award-winning menu, unique attractions and one-of-a-kind capabilities.<\/p>\n\n<p>Come out to the Wildhorse Saloon for some live music and line dancing!<\/p>","datePosted":"2016-02-02 03:12:49","link":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/live-music-at-wildhorse-saloon\/","guid":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/live-music-at-wildhorse-saloon\/","source":"www.nowplayingnashville.com","dates":["06-07-2016","06-08-2016","06-09-2016","06-10-2016","06-11-2016","06-12-2016","06-13-2016","06-14-2016","06-15-2016","06-16-2016","06-17-2016","06-18-2016","06-19-2016","06-20-2016"],"datetimes":[{"date":"06-07-2016","date2":"JUN 07, 2016","time":"5:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-07 17:00","time2":"5 PM Tuesday","endtime":"11:59 pm","timeendtime":"5pm-11:59pm"},{"date":"06-08-2016","date2":"JUN 08, 2016","time":"5:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-08 17:00","time2":"5 PM Wednesday","endtime":"11:59 pm","timeendtime":"5pm-11:59pm"},{"date":"06-09-2016","date2":"JUN 09, 2016","time":"5:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-09 17:00","time2":"5 PM Thursday","endtime":"11:59 pm","timeendtime":"5pm-11:59pm"},{"date":"06-10-2016","date2":"JUN 10, 2016","time":"5:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-10 17:00","time2":"5 PM Friday","endtime":"11:59 pm","timeendtime":"5pm-11:59pm"},{"date":"06-11-2016","date2":"JUN 11, 2016","time":"5:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-11 17:00","time2":"5 PM Saturday","endtime":"11:59 pm","timeendtime":"5pm-11:59pm"},{"date":"06-12-2016","date2":"JUN 12, 2016","time":"5:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-12 17:00","time2":"5 PM Sunday","endtime":"11:59 pm","timeendtime":"5pm-11:59pm"},{"date":"06-13-2016","date2":"JUN 13, 2016","time":"5:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-13 17:00","time2":"5 PM Monday","endtime":"11:59 pm","timeendtime":"5pm-11:59pm"},{"date":"06-14-2016","date2":"JUN 14, 2016","time":"5:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-14 17:00","time2":"5 PM Tuesday","endtime":"11:59 pm","timeendtime":"5pm-11:59pm"},{"date":"06-15-2016","date2":"JUN 15, 2016","time":"5:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-15 17:00","time2":"5 PM Wednesday","endtime":"11:59 pm","timeendtime":"5pm-11:59pm"},{"date":"06-16-2016","date2":"JUN 16, 2016","time":"5:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-16 17:00","time2":"5 PM Thursday","endtime":"11:59 pm","timeendtime":"5pm-11:59pm"},{"date":"06-17-2016","date2":"JUN 17, 2016","time":"5:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-17 17:00","time2":"5 PM Friday","endtime":"11:59 pm","timeendtime":"5pm-11:59pm"},{"date":"06-18-2016","date2":"JUN 18, 2016","time":"5:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-18 17:00","time2":"5 PM Saturday","endtime":"11:59 pm","timeendtime":"5pm-11:59pm"},{"date":"06-19-2016","date2":"JUN 19, 2016","time":"5:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-19 17:00","time2":"5 PM Sunday","endtime":"11:59 pm","timeendtime":"5pm-11:59pm"},{"date":"06-20-2016","date2":"JUN 20, 2016","time":"5:00 pm","timem":"2016-06-20 17:00","time2":"5 PM Monday","endtime":"11:59 pm","timeendtime":"5pm-11:59pm"}]},{"ID":"117897","spotlight":"false","featured":"false","orgImage":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/images\/org\/66286\/john_a.jpeg","Image":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/images\/2016\/02\/chazzW_edited-1.jpg","Name":"Chazz Wesley and the TCM (TraditionalCountryMusic) Band","DateBegin":"02-21-2016","DateEnd":"02-26-2017","Days":"Sunday,Friday,Saturday","ongoing":"Y","orgID":"66286","orgName":"John A's","Url":"http:\/\/www.nowplayingnashville.com\/event\/chazz-wesley-and-the-tcm-band-2\/","venueID":"2924","venueName":"John A's","TicketInfo":"<p>No Cover charge to enter, but please TIP the Band in the tip jar.
